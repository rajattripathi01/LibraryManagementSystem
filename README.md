# Library Management System in Core Java ðŸ“šðŸš€



## Overview
A simple yet functional Library Management System built in Core Java. This system allows managing books and student details efficiently using Javaâ€™s Collections Framework. Itâ€™s a perfect project to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts, data structures, and file-free storage using HashMap.
## Features
* Add Books : Preloaded with sample books, with support to extend dynamically.

* View All Books : Display all books with unique IDs, author names, and availability status.

* Search a Book : Search books by name (case-insensitive).

* Issue a Book : Issue a book to a student and mark it as unavailable.

* Return a Book : Return issued books and update availability.

* Track Issued Books : Map each issued book to the corresponding student (name & roll number).

* Menu-Driven Interface : Simple console-based navigation for easy usage.
## How to Run

  * Open the project in any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).

  * Run the Main.java class.

  * Use the menu options to interact with the system:

       * View all books
       * Search a book
       * Issue a book
       * Return a book
       * Exit
## Learning Outcomes

* Applied OOP principles like encapsulation and abstraction.

* Used Collections Framework (HashMap) for efficient data storage.

* Practiced input handling and validation using Scanner.

* Learned to structure a multi-class project for better readability and maintainability.
